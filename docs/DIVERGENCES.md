# Divergences from Java Freerouting

Places where the Rust port deliberately behaves differently from the Java reference
(`danbrunski/freerouting` at `cda540f`). Anything not listed here is meant to match
Java; a difference that isn't listed is a bug in the port.

Each crate's docs carry the full detail; this file is the index.

## freerouting-geometry

**Java bugs fixed**
- Polygon-vs-polygon `intersects` tests the convex pieces; Java recursed forever.
- `TileShape::rotate_approx` with two corners uses segment index 1; Java used index 0
  and threw a `NullPointerException`.

**Java failures that became defined results**
- `distance`/`border_distance` on an empty shape or polyline return infinity.
- `nearest_border_points_approx` drops missing points instead of returning nulls.
- `remove_redundant_lines` on an empty simplex returns it unchanged; a `PolygonShape`
  built from an empty polygon is an empty shape.
- A failed polygon split counts as no pieces in contains/intersects. In
  `PolylineArea::split_to_convex` a failed cutout fails the split, results are cached only
  on success, and a stop request returns `None`.

**Stricter than Java (panic instead of a later failure)**
- `Line` accepts only integer points; out-of-range `LineSegment`/`Polyline`
  constructors and `Polyline::corner()` on fewer than two lines panic.

**API shape**
- `null` returns become `Option`; indices are `usize` and "-1 = not found" is `None`.
- IntOctagon `is_empty` compares by value; its `toSimplex` cache is gone. Logging is gone.
- `sin`/`cos` may differ from Java's `Math` by one ulp.

**Java bugs kept on purpose** (changing them would change routing results; revisit once
the router is ported and measurable): `RationalPoint.perpendicularProjection`, the int
overflow in `Line.length`, `stairApproximation45` evaluating `functionValueApprox` for
the function-of-y case, the `index_of_nearest_corner` quirk, `PolygonShape.area`
returning 0, `Simplex.cutoutFrom` never setting its previous division line, the no-op
branch 3 in IntOctagon's box cutout.

## freerouting-dsn

- Non-ASCII characters in names are kept; Java's JFlex scanner drops them.
- Tabs and newlines count as blanks in raw string reads; `'` is accepted as a quote;
  empty quoted names are skipped anywhere in a list.
- Malformed scopes where Java loses track of brackets (a class with no sub-scopes, a
  layer_rule with several rule scopes, a place without side or rotation, extra tokens
  before `)`) produce warnings instead.
- `autoroute_settings` is always read; Java reads it only before the first keepout or
  plane.
- The writer emits `snap_angle` and `via_rule`; Java's writer emits `snapAngle` and
  `viaRule`, which its own reader doesn't recognise.
- `.5` is a number; `pcb` and `signal` layer names match in any case; degenerate shapes
  are kept; names may be keywords or numbers.
- A non-integer value for an integer setting leaves it unset with a warning.
- An unterminated string or `/*` comment is an error at its start, not at end of file.
